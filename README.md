# Meaning from Monitoring
This is a project to examine the public health impacts of emissions from oil refineries in the Bay Area. It is a project of the Fair Tech Collective, led by Gwen Ottinger, Associate Professor, Drexel University and Dawn Nafus, Intel.

This open-source code allows citizen scientists and community health advocates to gather statistical evidence of personal and public health impacts from refinery pollution. The code is entirely modifiable, requiring only knowledge of the R programming language. However, knowledge of R is not needed to gather statistics from your data. We have clearly marked a few areas that require input, but it is like filling out a document. Not fun, but easy, and gives meaning to your monitoring.
